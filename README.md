# IHM

Multi threaded Human-Machine interface embedded on a raspberry. 

This code is embedded on a raspberry which is integrated into a tab with a touchscreen. 
This tab is connected throught UDP network to differents drives like joystick.
We can connect up to 5 robots and drive them.

I put the code here even if it's working because i'm sure it can be optimized. 

Working with PYQT5, socket and Threading module.

To launch the app on a computer : Put rasp_config to False at the top of ihm.py (on a raspberry: True) then: sudo python3 ihm.py
